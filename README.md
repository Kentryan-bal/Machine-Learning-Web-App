# Machine-Learning-Web-App
This project is a Streamlit-based web application for binary classification using machine learning models. The app is designed to predict whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous based on their features.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit, allowing users to select classifiers and tune model hyperparameters from the sidebar.
- **Supported Classifiers:** 
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- **Model Metrics:** Displays accuracy, precision, and recall for predictions.
- **Visualization:** Plots Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve for model evaluation.
- **Data Handling:** Loads and encodes the mushroom dataset (`mushrooms.csv`) for classification.
- **Raw Data View:** Option to display the raw mushroom dataset in the app.
